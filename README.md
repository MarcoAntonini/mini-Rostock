mini-Rostock
============


The Rostock mini is a delta 3D printer based on the modified design of the original Rostock created by Johann.
The printer is designed to have a smaller build volume allowing for a smaller, more compact, portable, and desktop friendly version of the delta RepRap design.

This repository is a fork of the original version designed by [Brian Evans](http://www.thingiverse.com/bwevans) with some improvements.

Changes from the orignal project:

* Update carriage,idler_end,platform to accomodate Traxxas 5347 u-joints (According to the latest changes from [Luke](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:51288) )
* Enlarged frame for the MK1 hot-bed (greater print area)
* Update Extruder with MakerGear Bowden Filament drive
